# **App Name**: Adventure Folio

## Core Features:

- Character Creation: Character creation: Guide users through a multi-step character creation flow.
- Character Leveling: Character leveling: Enable users to level up their characters, selecting subclasses, spells, and features as they progress.
- Inventory Management: Inventory management: Provide an interface for equipping/unequipping items and tracking item stats.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, desaturated blue (#4A6572), evocative of mystery and ancient knowledge. In HSL space, this hue evokes thought and reflection, as is needed when one decides on which kind of character to roleplay as.
- Background color: Dark grey (#222831), providing a dark mode-first experience and ensuring readability.
- Accent color: A vibrant, brighter blue (#698F9C) as an analogous accent for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, giving the UI a modern, neutral appearance.
- Use simple, outline-style icons related to character stats and abilities.
- Responsive design that adapts fluidly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback when leveling up or managing inventory.
